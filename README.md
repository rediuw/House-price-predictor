Great observation — and you're right to be thinking about **tone**. The current README leans a bit too academic, almost like course notes or a report. If you're putting this on GitHub as a portfolio piece or to show your learning, it's better to:

### ✅ **Balance educational value with practical clarity**:

Make it clear that it's a **learning project** without sounding like a tutorial or lecture.

### 🔄 Here's a revised version — more casual, clean, and GitHub-ready:

# 🏡 House Price Predictor (Linear Regression)

This project is a hands-on implementation of a **linear regression model** for predicting house prices using the **California Housing dataset**. Built as part of a **Machine Learning course**, it covers the full pipeline — from data preparation to evaluation and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Loads real-world data with `fetch_california_housing`
- Scales features using `StandardScaler`
- Trains and tests a `LinearRegression` model from scikit-learn
- Evaluates with **Mean Squared Error** and **R² score**
- Visualizes predictions vs. actual prices
